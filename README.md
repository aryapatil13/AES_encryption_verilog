# AES_encryption_verilog
This project implements a fully functional AES-128 encryption core in Verilog, suitable for FPGA implementation.

Features
- Implements AES-128 standard (encryption and decryption)
- Modular design: key expansion, round logic, S-box
- Testbench for simulation
- Works with Vivado 2019.1

Project Structure
- `src/` – AES core Verilog modules
- `sim/` – Testbench
